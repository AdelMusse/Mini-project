                <p>
                        I have encountered web development in my second semester of 
                        Foundation Information Technology and since then I was fascinated with it. 
                        After I dropped college due to my financial issue. I 
                        started navigating more about web development and how to make a page responsive. 
                        In college, they didn't show me much about web development and how to make 
                        a page function or how to make it responsive.
                         I started learning basic HTML and CSS through websites like (W3school). 
                         I have never been through the Javascript in depth. 
                         I believe the course will help me a lot and once I master web development whether back-end, 
                         front-end or full stack with this Recode programme. 
                         I will get great opportunities in the business markets and mainly 
                         I will get more knowledge and fun! This is why I want to join the programme.
